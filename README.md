# Poddit

This is a 2025 rewrite of one of Vincent Tunru's famous Solid apps, [Poddit](https://gitlab.com/vincenttunru/poddit), making it compatible with [Pivot](https://github.com/solid-contrib/pivot).

## Development
It uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), so you can run `npm run dev` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result; then start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
